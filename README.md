# AZ-500 Study Notes

This repository contains personal study notes for the Microsoft AZ-500 certification: Microsoft Azure Security Technologies.

It includes:
- Conceptual summaries of key security components in Azure
- Comparisons of technologies such as NSG vs Azure Firewall, RBAC vs PIM
- Notes on governance, monitoring, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Materials written in English as part of my professional development and ACS preparation

All content is based on my own learning and exam preparation for the AZ-500 exam, which I passed in June 2025.
